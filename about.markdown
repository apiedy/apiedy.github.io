As a senior software engineer at Bank of America, I lead a development team which delivers a mobile app for the [Corporate Cards (Global Card Access)](https://www.bofaml.com/en-us/content/card-solutions.html) group, providing credit card management solutions to over a million users globally.

Prior to Bank of America, my experience includes working for IT consulting companies delivering high impact applications and multiple high growth SaaS companies, including India's leading free payroll service provider, [SumoPayroll](https://www.sumopayroll.com).
