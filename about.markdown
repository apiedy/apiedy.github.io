As Senior Software Engineer at Bank of America, I lead a development team delivering a mobile app solution for [Corporate Cards (Global Card Access)](https://www.bofaml.com/en-us/content/card-solutions.html), providing credit card management solutions to over a million users globally.

Prior to Bank of America, I've worked at Nexient, a California based IT services company, where I worked on developing a mobile application, for one of Americaâ€™s top home improvement supplies retailers, that offers workforce solutions to nearly 400,000 employees.

I launched my career through my own startup and then transitioning into working for multiple high growth SaaS companies, including India's leading free payroll service provider, [SumoPayroll](https://www.sumopayroll.com/).
